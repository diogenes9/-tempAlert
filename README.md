Python 2.7 code to use a Hologram Nova cellular modem to report high temperatures via IFTTT. It must run sudo'd or out of root's cron, depending on which version you use. A Python3 version is in the works.

The Hologram cellular infrastructure suppors something called a "data router" and most similar examples appare to use that while hinting darkly at the frustration involved with it and the lack of documentation. I bypassed all that by simply POSTing to IFTTT.
